- do not use hatchling for building 
- when using a library, regularly consider searching the web for the usage of the library first before implementing code to ensure you have the API of the library right. 
- use uv for python packaging and dependency management. 
- always update the [todo.txt](mdc:todo.txt) if you did some material work
- always run `make test` when updating code or tests to ensure everything still works as expected.
