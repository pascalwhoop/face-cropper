    - [x] Improved error handling with custom exceptions
    - [x] Fixed face detection array handling
    - [x] Added proper input validation

## Phase 2: Frontend Setup

- [x] Install and configure ShadCN/UI
- [x] Create basic project structure (pages, components, etc.)
- [x] Set up API client utilities
  - [x] Configure OpenAPI client generation
  - [x] Set up environment-based API configuration
  - [x] Implement proper response handling for binary data

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

- [ ] add validation to check if user has enough credits before processing, return helpful error message
- [ ] add toast notification to user when they are nearing their credit limit

## Phase 6: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow with multiple images
- [ ] Optimize performance and UX
  - [ ] Implement proper blob URL cleanup
  - [ ] Add retry logic for failed requests
  - [ ] Optimize memory usage for large batches
- [ ] Add final polish and documentation
- [ ] Test cross-browser compatibility
