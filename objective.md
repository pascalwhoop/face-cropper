# Face Detection and Smart Cropping Service

## Project Vision
To create an intelligent image processing service that automatically detects faces and
creates perfectly cropped images for various social media platforms and use cases. Our
solution aims to eliminate the tedious manual work of image cropping while ensuring the
subject remains perfectly framed.

## Core Objectives

1. Face Detection and Smart Cropping
   - Automatically detect faces in uploaded images
   - Intelligently crop images while keeping faces centered
   - Support multiple aspect ratios (9:16 for stories, 1:1 for profiles, 2:3 for portraits)
   - Provide zoom control for fine-tuning the crop area

2. Technical Excellence
   - Fast and efficient image processing using OpenCV
   - Clean API design with FastAPI
   - Type safety with Pydantic
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Modern async processing for better performance

3. User Experience
   - Simple REST API interface
   - Flexible output formats
   - Clear error messages and validation
   - Easy integration for developers

## Key Features

1. Smart Face Detection
   - Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier
   - Handles multiple faces by focusing on the largest/most prominent
   - Falls back gracefully when no faces are detected

2. Flexible Aspect Ratios
   - Portrait (9:16) for stories and vertical content
   - Square (1:1) for profile pictures and thumbnails
   - Photo (2:3) for traditional portrait photography
   - Original ratio preservation option

3. Zoom Control
   - Range from 0.0 (maximum padding) to 1.0 (tight crop)
   - Allows fine-tuning of the crop area around detected faces

## Target Users

1. Developers
   - Building social media applications
   - Creating content management systems
   - Implementing automated image processing pipelines

2. Content Creators
   - Social media managers
   - Photographers
   - Marketing teams

3. Businesses
   - E-commerce platforms requiring product photo processing
   - Social media platforms
   - Content management systems

## Future Enhancements

1. Advanced Features
   - Multiple face handling options
   - Face recognition for specific person focusing
   - Additional aspect ratios for new platforms
   - Batch processing capabilities

2. Platform Evolution
   - Web interface for direct usage
   - SDK packages for popular programming languages
   - Cloud deployment options
   - Integration with popular CMS platforms

## Success Metrics

1. Technical Performance
   - Processing speed under 500ms per image
   - 99.9% service uptime
   - >95% face detection accuracy
   - Zero data loss

2. User Satisfaction
   - Reduced time spent on manual image cropping
   - Consistent, high-quality outputs
   - Easy integration experience
   - Positive developer feedback

## Project Values

1. Quality First
   - Robust error handling
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Clear documentation
   - Type safety

2. Developer Experience
   - Intuitive API design
   - Detailed documentation
   - Quick start guides
