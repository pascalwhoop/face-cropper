# Your rule content

- Use our shadcn libraries available in frontend/components for any UI development. Make sure to keep to ShadCN beset practices. 
- do not use any other competing library that is solving the same problem as ShadCN unless explicitly instructed (e.g. no use of prime-react or similar)
- use the sonner component rather than toasts
